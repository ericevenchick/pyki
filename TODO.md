TODO for PyKi
=============

### Schematic Files ###
Add import/export for FPLIST and ALIAS

### DCM Files ###
* Import DCM files along with schematic LIB files
* Export DCM files as well

### Mass Library Import ###
* Grab a bunch of library files from the web
* Write a script to crawl through them, import, export, compare
* If compare matches, add to massive library file
* If not, throw error, debug, rinse, repeat.

### Library Storage ###
* Figure out a good method to store components in a database rather than a 
  library file.

### Footprint Libraries ###
